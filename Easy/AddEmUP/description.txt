Goal
Given a list of integers, add them up.
Wait... it will not be that easy.

Now there is an extra property to the operator ADD.
When you add a and b, it involves a cost of a+b.

If the list of numbers is 1, 2, 3
you can add them up in several ways.

Approach 1
1 + 2 = 3 (cost = 3)
3 + 3 = 6 (cost = 6)
Total cost = 9

Approach 2
1 + 3 = 4 (cost = 4)
4 + 2 = 6 (cost = 6)
Total cost = 10

Approach 3
2 + 3 = 5 (cost = 5)
5 + 1 = 6 (cost = 6)
Total cost = 11

Find the lowest cost to finish the addition.
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of integers to add up
Line 2: N positive integers separated by space
Output
Line 1 : The lowest total cost of finishing the additions
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 5000
each integer x will be 0 < x ≤ 100000
Example
Input
